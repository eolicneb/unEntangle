# unEntangle
The game "entangled" consists on a set of movable dots on a board. Many of them are linked by lines that intercross each other. The game consists on moving the dots so that at the end no lines overlap anymore. This Fortran code not only generates an aleatory party of the game but also uses a push-pull physical aproach to get the board as near as possible from a solution. The model applied consists on making the lines elastic and placing repulsive masses in these lines midpoints. By starting with highly stretched lines, the system has plenty of energy as to solve the game as much as possible.
